# gaussian_processes_teishutu
Python implementation of a regression model using Gaussian Process. It can be executed in a virtual environment (Conda).
The learning process of the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) will be shown as an animation using matplotlib.

## Environment Setup

Follow these steps to set up the development environment for this project:

### 1 Install Conda (if not installed)
Ensure you have **Miniconda** or **Anaconda** installed. If not, download and install Miniconda

### 2️ Create a Virtual Environment
You can create the environment using the provided `environment.yml` file:
　
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml


#　After installation, activate the environment:
　
```bash
conda activate my_gaussian_env


# If FFmpeg does not work as expected, install it manually:
　
```bash
choco install ffmpeg
